# Project Name: Password Access Control System
## Sabancı University Logic and Digital System Design Term Project 

## Overview
This project consists of a series of digital circuits designed to simulate a secure access control system. It includes modules for mode selection, password management, project registration, shifting mechanisms, and timing controls. Each module is represented by a .dig file, which outlines the circuit design and functionality in an XML format suitable for simulation tools or implementation on physical hardware.

## Files Description
mode_selector.dig: Manages the selection of operational modes based on input criteria. It can be used to switch between different states or functionalities within the system.
password.hex: A hexadecimal file possibly containing encrypted password data or key values for authentication processes.
proj_reg.dig: Likely involved in the registration or initialization of project-specific parameters or configurations.
project.dig: Represents the main circuit or the core framework of the access control system, integrating various functionalities.
shifter.dig and shifter_pwd.dig: These files are presumably related to the shifting mechanism, possibly for password or data encryption/decryption processes.
timer.dig: Implements timing functions, which could be used for timeout sessions, delay mechanisms, or scheduling tasks within the system.

## Setup
To use these circuit designs, you will need a digital circuit simulation tool or a physical platform that supports the loading and execution of .dig files. Import the files into your simulation tool or configure the hardware accordingly to assemble the system.

## Usage
Each file contributes to a part of the access control system:

Start by setting up the project.dig as the central framework.
Utilize mode_selector.dig to define the operational state of the system.
Implement timer.dig for managing time-based operations.
Configure proj_reg.dig for initial settings or registrations.
Use shifter.dig and shifter_pwd.dig for any data manipulation requirements.
Refer to password.hex for handling authentication mechanisms.
The interaction between these modules creates a comprehensive access control system capable of managing entry or access through secure authentication and operational flexibility.
